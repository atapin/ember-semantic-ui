## Pull Requests

I follow [git-flow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/), and while you don't necessarily need to follow it yourself, pull requests will only be accepted against the **develop** branch. This branch will always contain the latest development work, and as such will not be guaranteed to be stable.

When the **develop** branch is in a stable state and features added to it are finalized, I will merge it into **master**, and update the version as appropriate per [semantic versioning](http://semver.org). At that point, [NPM](http://npmjs.org) will also receive the new release version, and **develop** will be updated with the release changes.
